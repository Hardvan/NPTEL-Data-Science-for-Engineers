# Key Definitions

## Deterministic Phenomena

Outcome is known with certainty (Eg: age of a person).

## Probabilistic Phenomena

Many possible outcomes for the same experimental conditions (Eg: coin toss).

## Independent Events

$P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)$  
So,  
$P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B)$

## Mutually Exclusive Events

$P(A ∩ B) = 0$  
So,  
$P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)$

## Gaussian/Normal Distribution

Represented as: x ~ N(μ, σ²)

where,  
x = random variable  
N = normal distribution  
μ = mean  
σ² = variance

## Standard Normal Distribution

z ~ N(0, 1)

where,  
z = random variable  
μ = 0  
σ² = 1

## Hypotheses Testing

### Null Hypothesis (H₀)

Default or status quo postulate that we wish to reject if the sample set provides sufficient evidence.
Eg: η = η₀

### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)

An alternative postulate that is accepted if the null hypothesis is rejected.
Eg: η < η₀

### Two-sided and One-sided tests

#### Two-sided test

H₀: μ = 0  
H₁: μ ≠ 0

#### One-sided test

H₀: μ = 0  
H₁: μ > 0

## Errors in Hypotheses Testing

### Type I Error (α)

Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.  
Also known as **false positive**.  
The probability of making a type I error is α, which is the level of significance you set for your hypothesis test.

### Type II Error (β)

Accepting the null hypothesis when it is false.  
Also known as **false negative**.  
The probability of making a type II error is β, which depends on the power of the test.
